# ECE365-DSA-II
Source codes for ECE-365 Data Structure &amp; Algorithm II at Cooper Union

A continuation of ECE-264, also with an emphasis on practical implementation issues and good programming methodology. Topics include graphs, graph-related algorithms and dynamic programming techniques. Also an introduction to some advanced topics such as Turing machines, computability and NP-complete systems. Assignments include programming projects and problem sets.
